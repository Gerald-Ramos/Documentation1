       Coronaviruses are a family of viruses known for containing strains that cause potentially deadly diseases in mammals and birds.

In humans they're typically spread via airborne droplets of fluid produced by infected individuals.

Of the seven coronaviruses kown to infect humans, four spread with seasonal regularity, causing anything from mild cold-like symptoms to flu-like discomforts.</p>    

<p>A few more notable strains, including SARS-CoV-2 (responsible for COVID-19), and those responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), can cause death in humans. The cause of death is complex, though is typically the result of heightened immune responses causing damage in multiple systems throughout the body. </p>

    <header>The Origin of Covid-19</header>
    <article>
      <p>Experts say SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats. That’s also how the coronaviruses behind Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) got started.</p>

<p>SARS-CoV-2 made the jump to humans at one of Wuhan’s open-air “wet markets.” They’re where customers buy fresh meat and fish, including animals that are killed on the spot.</p>

<p>Some wet markets sell wild or banned species like cobras, wild boars, and raccoon dogs. Crowded conditions can let viruses from different animals swap genes. Sometimes the virus changes so much it can start to infect and spread among people.</p>
<p>
Still, the Wuhan market didn’t sell bats at the time of the outbreak. That’s why early suspicion also fell on pangolins, also called scaly anteaters, which are sold illegally in some markets in China. Some coronaviruses that infect pangolins are similar to SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>
As SARS-CoV-2 spread both inside and outside China, it infected people who have had no direct contact with animals. That meant the virus is transmitted from one human to another. It’s now spreading in the U.S. and around the globe, meaning that people are unwittingly catching and passing on the coronavirus. This growing worldwide transmission is what is now a pandemic.</p>

      <p>
       Scientists first identified a human coronavirus in 1965. It caused a common cold. Later that decade, researchers found a group of similar human and animal viruses and named them after their crown-like appearance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Seven coronaviruses can infect humans. The one that causes SARS emerged in southern China in 2002 and quickly spread to 28 other countries. More than 8,000 people were infected by July 2003, and 774 died. A small outbreak in 2004 involved only four more cases. This coronavirus causes fever, headache, and respiratory problems such as cough and shortness of breath.
      </p>
      <p>
        MERS started in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Almost all of the nearly 2,500 cases have been in people who live in or travel to the Middle East. This coronavirus is less contagious than its SARS cousin but more deadly, killing 858 people. It has the same respiratory symptoms but can also cause kidney failure.

    <header>Why is it called a Coronavirus</header>
    <article>
     First described in detail in the 1960s, the coronavirus gets its name from a distinctive corona or 'crown' of sugary-proteins that projects from the envelope surrounding the particle. Encoding the virus's make-up is the longest genome of any RNA-based virus – a single strand of nucleic acid roughly 26,000 to 32,000 bases long. <br>
     
      <img src="https://wp.uthscsa.edu/coronavirus/wp-content/uploads/sites/150/2020/03/coronavirus-under-the-microscope-1-scaled.jpg" width="450" height="200" align="Middle"> <br>
      There are four known genuses in the family, named Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. The first two only infect mammals, including bats, pigs, cats, and humans. Gammacoronavirus mostly infects birds such as poultry, while Deltacoronavirus can infect both birds and mammals.

    <header>Symptoms</header>
    
      <p>
       Coronaviruses can give rise to a variety of symptoms in different animals. In a high percentage of cases, infection causes no symptoms at all. These individuals can still easily spread the virus without knowing they're infected.
      </p>
      <p>
       While some strains cause diarrhoea in pigs and in turkeys, in humans infections are usually compared to a bad cold, causing mild to moderate upper respiratory problems such as a runny nose and sore throat.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a handful of lethal exceptions, which have had a devastating impact on livestock and human health around the globe. Symptoms in these cases tend to start with a sore throat and fever.
      </p>
      <p>In the specific case of the novel coronavirus COVID-19, most of those infected experience a fever within five days of being infected, followed by a cough. This differs to a flu, which tends to start with a cough.</p>
      <p>Severe cases can require hospitalisation from respiratory distress within about a week of the first symptoms showing. Where symptoms continue to worsen, death can follow within two weeks to nearly two months, depending on prognosis and medical care.</p>

    <header>How Dangerous is Covid-19?</header>
    <article>
      
      <p>
      As the novel coronavirus continues to spread throughout the world, keeping people and businesses in our communities and across the United States shuttered, the virus is clearly something to be feared.
      </p>
      <p>
      But of the many viruses known to infect humans, what makes this one, which has caused the worst pandemic in a century, so dangerous?
      </p>
      <p>
       The virus that causes COVID-19 is not the most deadly. Ebola kills upwards of 50% of people it infects. The coronaviruses that cause Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) result in death in about 10% of infections and between 30% to 40% of cases, respectively.
      </p>
      <p>Although scientists won’t know for sure until testing becomes widespread, COVID-19 could be about 10 times more deadly than the seasonal flu, which leads to death in about 0.1% of those it infects, says Donald N. Forthal, MD, professor of medicine and molecular biology and biochemistry, and chief of infectious diseases at UCI School of Medicine.</p>
      <p>Researchers also don’t have accurate enough numbers to determine the actual percentage of deaths that result from this viral infection, given that there are a great many mild cases, as well as deaths, that have gone unreported.</p>
      <p>But Forthal expects the mortality rate to be lower than what we’re seeing today in hotspots around the globe once the data are finally collected.

It’s not the most contagious virus, either.</p>

<p>Michael J. Buchmeier, PhD, professor of infectious diseases at UCI School of Medicine, explains that this virus, while deadly, is thought to be about as contagious as the seasonal flu, with one person infecting another two or three.</p>

<p>Contrast that with measles, where one person can infect 18, or chicken pox, where one person can infect 12. But these two highly contagious diseases are controlled by vaccination.</p>
<p>But it is a virus that has never been seen in humans, so absolutely no one is immune to it. That added to the fact that it spreads as easily from person to person as influenza, and infects the upper respiratory system, is what makes it so dangerous. Plus there is no vaccine.</p>
<p>Because the COVID-19 virus is found in the upper airway — including the mouth and nose — the infection can be spread through coughs, sneezes, huffing and puffing, and likely even loud talking, according to Forthal.</p>
<p>Moreover, we are learning that infected people are unknowingly spreading the virus days before they begin to experience symptoms. Some may not experience symptoms at all.</p>
<p>Neither SARS nor MERS spread as easily or widely.

This new virus "is capable of causing very severe disease,” Buchmeier says. </p>

    <header>Treatment</header>
    <article>
      <p>
       Most people who become ill with COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. Some of the same things you do to feel better if you have the flu — getting enough rest, staying well hydrated, and taking medications to relieve fever and aches and pains — also help with COVID-19.
      </p>

      <p>
       Beyond that, the FDA has also authorized treatments that may be used for people who have been hospitalized with COVID-19 and other medications to curb the progression of COVID-19 in people who are not hospitalized but who are at risk for developing severe illness. Scientists continue working hard to develop other effective treatments.
      </p>
      Let your doctor know that you have COVID-19. Some people who are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 illness may be candidates for oral antiviral treatment or intravenous monoclonal antibody therapy, both of which can reduce the risk of hospitalization and death.

If you’ve been told to recover at home, these measures can help reduce symptoms:
      <li>While you don't need to stay in bed, you should get plenty of rest.</li>
      <li>Stay well hydrated.</li>
      <li>To reduce fever and ease aches and pains, take acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Be sure to follow directions. If you are taking any combination cold or flu medicine, keep track of all the ingredients and the doses. For acetaminophen, the total daily dose from all products should not exceed 3,000 milligrams.</li>
       <h3>Is it safe to take ibuprofen to treat symptoms of COVID-19?</h3>
       <p>Early in the pandemic, there were some concerns that NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) and naproxen (Aleve) might not be safe for people with COVID-19. However, the CDC now recommends taking medications, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, to relieve fever if you have COVID-19. And the WHO has stated that there is no evidence that ibuprofen has any negative effects for people with COVID-19.</p>

       <h3>What therapies can help people who are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 to avoid hospitalization?</h3>
       <p>There are currently two FDA-authorized monoclonal antibody treatments that may be used to treat non-hospitalized adults and children over age 12 with mild to moderate symptoms who have recently tested positive for COVID-19, and who are at risk for developing severe COVID-19 or being hospitalized for it. These therapies must be given intravenously (by IV) soon after developing symptoms.</p>
       <p>The monoclonal antibody treatments that have FDA authorization are: sotrovimab, made by GlaxoSmithKline, and bebtelovimab, made by Eli Lilly. Both appear to be effective against the Omicron variant; in laboratory tests, bebtelovimab was also effective against the BA.2 omicron subvariant.</p>
       <p>In addition, the FDA has authorized the oral antiviral medications Paxlovid and molnupiravir, which have been shown to lower the risk of hospitalization and death in people who are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness.</p>
